# CartoMapQA-Dataset
This repo contains the benchmark dataset introduced in the paper "CartoMapQA: A Fundamental Benchmark Dataset Evaluating Vision-Language Models on Cartographic Map Understanding".

We released the CartoMapQA dataset [here](https://github.com/ungquanghuy-kddi/CartoMapQA-Dataset/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

The source code for evaluating Large Vision Language Models in the paper is available [here](https://github.com/ungquanghuy-kddi/CartoMapQA).
